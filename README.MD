# Hacker News react clone

This is a hacker news react clone that I made to keep learning react.

The project is based on Tyler Mcginnis react final project that you can check here: <https://ui-hacker-news.netlify.com/>

The idea is that I'm going to build that app following my own process.

You can check the repo issues to know where I'm at.
